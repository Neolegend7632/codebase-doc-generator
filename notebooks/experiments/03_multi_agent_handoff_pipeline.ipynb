      "\n",
      "### Purpose\n",
      "The `UserValidator` class is designed to validate user input, specifically checking if a user meets the minimum age requirement and if their email belongs to an accepted domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Attributes\n",
      "- `min_age`: (int) Represents the minimum age required for validation.\n",
      "- `allowed_domains`: (list) A list of allowed email domains that a user's email must belong to for the validation to be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Constructor\n",
      "#### `__init__(self, min_age: int = 18, allowed_domains: list = None)`\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose**: Initializes the `UserValidator` instance with default parameters for minimum age and allowed email domains.\n",
      "- **Parameters**:\n",
      "  - `min_age` (int): The minimum age for validation; defaults to 18 if not provided.\n",
      "  - `allowed_domains` (list): A list of allowed email domains; defaults to an empty list if not provided.\n",
      "- **Return value**: None (constructor does not return anything).\n",
      "- **Edge cases**:\n",
      "  - If `allowed_domains` is not provided, it defaults to an empty list.\n",
      "- **Dependencies**: N/A\n",
      "\n",
      "### Method: `validate_age`\n",
      "\n",
      "#### `validate_age(self, age: int) -> bool`\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose**: Validates if the given age is greater than or equal to the minimum age set in the constructor.\n",
      "- **Parameters**:\n",
      "  - `age` (int): The age to validate against the minimum age requirement.\n",
      "- **Return value**: \n",
      "  - (bool) Returns `True` if the age is valid (greater than or equal to `min_age`), otherwise returns `False`.\n",
      "- **Edge cases**:\n",
      "  - Age values below zero can be considered invalid, but the function does not explicitly handle this scenario.\n",
      "- **Dependencies**: N/A\n",
      "\n",
      "### Method: `validate_email`\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Parameters**:\n",
      "  - `email` (str): The email address to validate.\n",
      "- **Return value**: \n",
      "  - (bool) Returns `True` if the email includes an \"@\" character and meets domain validation; otherwise returns `False`.\n",
      "- **Edge cases**:\n",
      "  - Emails without an \"@\" will immediately return `False`. \n",
      "  - If `allowed_domains` is empty, it automatically returns `True` for all domains.\n",
      "- **Dependencies**: Utilizes `self.allowed_domains` initialized in the constructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Method: `validate_user`\n",
      "\n",
      "#### `validate_user(self, age: int, email: str) -> dict`\n",
      "\n",

      "  - `age` (int): The age to validate.\n",
      "  - `email` (str): The email address to validate.\n",

      "    - `\"age_valid\"` (bool): Result of the age validation.\n",
      "    - `\"email_valid\"` (bool): Result of the email validation.\n",

      "   \n",
      "2. `validate_age` and `validate_email` are independent methods that handle their validations without relying on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notes:\n",
      "- The `UserValidator` class assumes that the email format is simple, checking only for the presence of an \"@\" symbol, which may not cover all aspects of valid email formatting.\n",

      "- **Purpose**: Validates if the provided age meets or exceeds the minimum age set during initialization.\n",
      "- **Parameters**:\n",
      "  - `age` (int): The age to validate against the minimum age requirement.\n",
      "- **Return value**: \n",
      "  - (bool) Returns `True` if the age is valid (greater than or equal to `min_age`), otherwise returns `False`.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Method: `validate_email(self, email: str) -> bool`\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose**: Checks if the provided email is formatted correctly and if its domain is part of the allowed domains set during object initialization.\n",
      "- **Parameters**:\n",
      "  - `email` (str): The email address to validate.\n",
      "- **Return value**: \n",
      "  - (bool) Returns `True` if the email contains an \"@\" character and its domain meets the criteria; otherwise returns `False`.\n",
      "- **Edge cases**: \n",
      "  - Emails without an \"@\" will return `False`.\n",
      "  - If `allowed_domains` is empty, it will automatically validate all domains as `True`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Method: `validate_user(self, age: int, email: str) -> dict`\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose**: Validates both the given age and email address of a user, returning a summary of the validation results in a dictionary format.\n",
      "- **Parameters**:\n",
      "  - `age` (int): The age to validate.\n",
      "  - `email` (str): The email address to validate.\n",
      "- **Return value**: \n",

      "    - `\"email_valid\"` (bool): Result of the email validation.\n",
      "- **Edge cases**: The method reflects each validation's result separately, allowing it to report back on any invalid input without exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Dependencies Among Methods:\n",
      "- `validate_user` method relies on:\n",
      "  - `validate_age` to determine if the age is valid.\n",
      "  - `validate_email` to determine if the email is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both `validate_age` and `validate_email` operate independently and do not rely on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notes:\n",
      "- The `UserValidator` class utilizes basic checks for email formatting, specifically focusing only on the presence of an \"@\" symbol, which may overlook other validities in more complex email validation scenarios.\n",
      "- The design of the class avoids raising exceptions for invalid inputs but opts for a return-based indication of validation results instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Usage Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example 1: Basic Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Initialize UserValidator with default settings\n",
      "validator = UserValidator()\n",
      "\n",
      "# Validate a user with valid age and email\n",
      "result = validator.validate_user(20, \"user@example.com\")\n",
      "print(result)  # Output: {'valid': True, 'age_valid': True, 'email_valid': True}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example 2: Validation with Allowed Domains\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Initialize UserValidator with specific allowed domains\n",
      "validator = UserValidator(min_age=21, allowed_domains=[\"example.com\", \"test.com\"])\n",
      "\n",
      "# Validate a user with age and email in allowed domains\n",
      "result = validator.validate_user(22, \"user@test.com\")\n",
      "print(result)  # Output: {'valid': True, 'age_valid': True, 'email_valid': True}\n",

      "print(result)  # Output: {'valid': False, 'age_valid': True, 'email_valid': False}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Edge Cases & Warnings\n",
      "- Be cautious about the handling of edge cases like negative age values. The class currently does not enforce checks for negative or excessively high age inputs.\n",
      "- The simple email validation may not suffice for applications requiring strict email format compliance. Consider using regex or more comprehensive validation if needed.\n",
      "- If no allowed domains are specified, all email domains will be deemed valid, which might not be the intended use in stricter validation contexts.\n"
